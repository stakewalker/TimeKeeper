# TimeKeeper

Project created for personal use, designed to track time just sending a picture. It enables me doing timecard log and monitor worked hours daily, weekly, monthly, etc.

This is a bot with a mission:
- Analyzing photos sent on a Telegram channel
- Extracts time data from printed documents
- Records it into a Google Sheets file
- Returns the time as a message response
- Process data (as you wish)

# TimeKeeper
This is a bot with a mission:
- Analyzing photos sent on a Telegram channel;
- Extracts time data from printed documents;
- Records it into a Google Sheets file;
- Returns the time as a message response;
- Process data (as you wish).

This is a personal project created for tracking my work hours easily, enabling me to log my timecard to monitor the hours worked per day, week, and month
